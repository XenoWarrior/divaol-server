# Diva Server
A private server for Diva Online using Pomelo.

# Usage
Non-commercial use only.

# Information
This server is currently in very early development.

StudioGM did not want to release the server code for Diva Online due to concerns of security risks (which is understandable).

So this server is being developed to work with the latest alpha client hosted on the StudioGM GitHub prepository.
